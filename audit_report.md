## 1. robots.txt — PASS ✅

```
User-agent: *
Allow: /
Sitemap: https://3dprintmap.com/sitemaps/sitemap.xml
```

**Findings:**
- No bots are blocked. All crawlers including Googlebot, GPTBot, ClaudeBot, and PerplexityBot have full access.
- Sitemap URL is correctly declared.

**Note:** The sitemap is at `/sitemaps/sitemap.xml`, not the conventional `/sitemap.xml`. A redirect is configured in `vercel.json` to handle `/sitemap.xml → /sitemaps/sitemap.xml`, but ensure Google Search Console is pointing to the correct URL when you submit it.

---

## 2. noindex Tags — PASS ✅

- **0 of 1,034** pre-rendered listing pages carry a `noindex` directive.
- All core pages carry `<meta name="robots" content="index, follow">`.
- No pages are accidentally blocking indexing.

---

## 3. Canonical URL Mismatch — CRITICAL ❌

**51 pages** declare canonical URLs ending in `.html`, but `cleanUrls: true` in `vercel.json` causes Vercel to serve these pages at URLs **without** the `.html` extension. Google will see a mismatch between the canonical tag and the URL it actually crawled.

**Example:**
```html
<!-- What the canonical tag says: -->
<link rel="canonical" href="https://www.3dprintmap.com/directory.html">

<!-- What Vercel actually serves the page at: -->
https://www.3dprintmap.com/directory
```

Google treats this as a hint conflict and may choose its own canonical — undermining all your link equity signals.

**Affected pages:**
- `/directory.html` → served as `/directory`
- `/fdm-printing.html` → served as `/fdm-printing`
- `/sla-resin.html` → served as `/sla-resin`
- `/sls-nylon.html` → served as `/sls-nylon`
- `/metal-printing.html` → served as `/metal-printing`
- `/technologies.html` → served as `/technologies`
- `/faq.html` → served as `/faq`
- `/about.html` → served as `/about`
- `/recommended-gear.html` → served as `/recommended-gear`
- `/blog/index.html` → served as `/blog/index`
- All remaining blog post pages (41 pages)

**Fix:** Strip `.html` from all canonical tags across all pages. This is a bulk find-and-replace across the codebase.

---

## 4. Duplicate Title Tags — RESOLVED ✅

~~**23 duplicate title tags**~~ All 20 affected listing pages updated with unique titles. Each duplicate chain location now includes its street address in the title to differentiate it from sibling locations in the same city.

**Format applied:** `Business Name - Street Address, City, ST | 3DPrintMap` (50–60 chars)

| 296 | Staples - 3701 Santa Rosalia, Los Angeles, CA \| 3DPrintMap | 58 |

| 469 | ARC Document Solutions - 555 W Beech, San Diego \| 3DPrintMap | 60 |
| 555 | ARC Document Solutions - Mira Mesa, San Diego \| 3DPrintMap | 58 |

**Notes:** FedEx Office Print & Ship Center abbreviated to "FedEx Office" (full name exceeds 60-char limit). State omitted on 3 titles where necessary to stay within limit. `<title>`, `og:title`, and `twitter:title` all updated. Fix applied via `fix-duplicate-titles.js`.

**Fix:** Add `<h1>Browse 3D Printing Services</h1>` to `directory.html`. Currently only rendered by JavaScript into `<div class="dir-results-header">`.

---

## 7. Title Tag Length — WARNING ⚠

Google truncates titles over ~60 characters in search results.

| Page | Length | Title |
|---|---|---|
| index.html | 47 ✅ | 3DPrintMap — Find 3D Printing Services Near You |
| directory.html | 40 ✅ | Browse 3D Printing Services — 3DPrintMap |
| fdm-printing.html | 46 ✅ | FDM 3D Printing Services Near You \| 3DPrintMap |
| sla-resin.html | 52 ✅ | SLA Resin 3D Printing Services Near You \| 3DPrintMap |

| recommended-gear.html | 77 ⚠ | Recommended 3D Printing Gear — Printers, Filaments & Accessories \| 3DPrintMap |

**Suggested fixes:**
- `technologies.html`: `"3D Printing Technologies Guide | 3DPrintMap"` (43 chars)
- `recommended-gear.html`: `"3D Printing Gear Guide | 3DPrintMap"` (36 chars)

---

## 8. Structured Data (JSON-LD) — WARNING ⚠

JSON-LD is the primary signal used by AI citation engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini) to understand and cite content authoritatively.

| Page | JSON-LD Present |
|---|---|
| index.html | ✅ WebSite + Organization |
| directory.html | ✅ CollectionPage + BreadcrumbList |
| fdm-printing.html | ✅ |
| technologies.html | ✅ |
| faq.html | ✅ FAQPage |
| listing pages | ✅ LocalBusiness + BreadcrumbList |
| **sla-resin.html** | ❌ Missing |
| **sls-nylon.html** | ❌ Missing |
| **metal-printing.html** | ❌ Missing |
| **about.html** | ❌ Missing |
| **blog/index.html** | ❌ Missing |
| **recommended-gear.html** | ❌ Missing |

**Fix:** Add an `ItemList` or `CollectionPage` JSON-LD block to the three technology pages, an `Organization` block to about.html, and a `Blog` schema to blog/index.html.

---

## 9. Open Graph & Twitter Cards — WARNING ⚠

Twitter card image (`twitter:image`) is missing on 6 pages. AI link-preview scrapers and social crawlers use this tag.

**Missing `twitter:image` on:**
- sla-resin.html
- sls-nylon.html
- metal-printing.html
- about.html
- blog/index.html
- recommended-gear.html

**Fix:** Add `<meta name="twitter:image" content="https://www.3dprintmap.com/og-default.png">` to these pages.

---

## 10. AI Citation Engine Readiness

AI engines (Perplexity, ChatGPT, Gemini) prioritize pages with:
- Unique, factual, first-party content ✅
- Structured data (JSON-LD) ⚠ — missing on 6 pages
- Clear author/publisher attribution (Organization schema) ⚠
- FAQ schema for Q&A content ✅ (faq.html has it)
- Canonical URLs that match served URLs ❌ — currently broken on 51 pages

**Recommendations for AI visibility:**
1. Fix the canonical mismatch (issue #3) — this is the highest priority
2. Add `Organization` JSON-LD with `sameAs` links to all pages (currently only on the homepage)
3. Consider adding an `ItemList` schema to the directory page listing top businesses
4. The blog city guides are strong candidates for AI citation — ensure each has `Article` schema (NYC, LA, Denver, Seattle posts already do; San Diego, SF, Atlanta posts need verification)
